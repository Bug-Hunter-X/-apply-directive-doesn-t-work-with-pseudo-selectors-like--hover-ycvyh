The solution is to avoid using `@apply` with pseudo-selectors. Apply the styles directly in the HTML or use JavaScript to handle the hover effect. Here's the corrected code:

```html
<button class="hover:bg-blue-500">
  Hover me
</button>
```

This approach directly applies the `bg-blue-500` class when the button is hovered without using the `@apply` directive.
